DataWave is a Java-based ingest and query framework that leverages [Apache Accumulo](http://accumulo.apache.org/) to provide fast, secure access to your data. DataWave supports a wide variety of use cases, including but not limited to...

* Data fusion across structured and unstructured datasets
* Construction and analysis of distributed graphs
* Multi-tenant data architectures, with tenants having distinct security requirements and data access patterns
* Fine-grained control over data access, integrated easily with existing user-authorization services and PKI

The easiest way to get started is the [DataWave Quickstart](contrib/datawave-quickstart/README.md)

Documentation is located [here](https://nationalsecurityagency.github.io/datawave/)
